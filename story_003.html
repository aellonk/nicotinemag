            <p class="text">In this recent body of work, I have been using brown hair as a surrogate for the body. I am interested in the way that hair is both visual and bodily, both of the body and separate from the body, both an object and part of a subject. In this way, hair lends itself towards urgent slippages, re-workings and inconstancy.

            <p class="text">Brown hair is one of the most familiar materials in my life. Most of the people I love are covered in brown hair. I touch and braid and tie up and take down my own brown hair many times a day. I became interested in the project of making this deeply familiar material seem alien or strange and in how that process of defamiliarization might alter my perception of it/myself. This has been a way to think more broadly about the relationship between intimacy and alienation and the potential for movement between categories. </p>

            <p class="text">Hair is also conceptually helpful to me because the hair that I paint is bodily and fem, but also an object. I’m interested in animating the hair-objects or making them seem active and alive. Instead of contesting the objectification of fem bodies, I’m concerned with questioning the passivity of objects and by doing that, trying to mess with ideas about subjectivity and objectivity. I also try to animate the hair-objects in ways that resonate with my own experiences, particularly feelings of excess, porousness, paralysis, feral-ness, or constriction. </p>

            <p class="text">I see these paintings as proposals for a set of absurd mutations that attempt to locate the partitions that have been installed between what is natural and what is unnatural. Sometimes they are distortions of an individual form but often they are relational mutations, like plants and hair behaving or interacting in anomalous ways. I’m not interested in a teleological idea of mutation, or in mutations that serve a particular moral or ecological goal. Rather, I’m interested in distortions of these various proxies for nature that call into question the assumed naturalness of the original.</p>
