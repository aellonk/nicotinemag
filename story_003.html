              * the purpose of conceptual fashion, and, in so far as it operates as a purveyor of conceptual fashion, the purpose of monogurui, is to reverse the flow that traditional fashion labels monetize, the flow from concept to material dress. conceiving of the process in terms of the financial markets, one can propose to treat the materialized fashion object as the bond that is funded by the revenue stream of this conceptual undertaking. to reverse it then is to create a synthetic asset from the process that profits, through the production of conceptual entities, from the reversed material good. or, in other words, to bubble the froth back out from the fashion industry's co-opted production into the stretching and mis/re-forming of reality to imaginative proportions.

attachment, becomes a ghost, .. at the moment of death such a person loses the future .. is fixed into an eternal present. the only time allowed is the past. thus, the ghost always appears as the figure it was in life .. reminisces about the single experience of profound memory that entraps it within the web of delusion': this one point, for britney spears(ii) was the experience of attacking the suv with an umbrella, with shaved head .. short shorts: this was the point of rupture which draws everything in, .. from which everything radiates: the monogurui-urakuomori found that this process could be controlled .. directed toward the production of mysterious powers: it functioned upon the repression of underlying uncontrollable forces of 'desire .. the will to metamorphosis': gray bodypaint of a synthetic substance was used on the face .. extremities to help contain interpulse release of build ups: later this would become the rubber goryo bodysuit used for engagement in monogurui processes): (the six ice-packed regions capture the powerful inward rushing .. reverb of the wind, pushing it back out or enclosing it, devouring it: mecha work over the surface on construction .. maintenance of tunnels, ventilation shafts, generators, irrigation, .. such: a clear hooded acrylic coldsuit with adidas logo (in weak blue, with medium pink letters) encloses (00_00)uedamhyka(ii)(00_00)'s body: hä coughs .. winces: small circle patterns allow här body's humidity to breathe: (6'8', powerful build, ½-jap. ½-urakuomori, one eye open slightly larger than the other, 2-braided black hair): (hä was probably reconciled to the idea that the arctic underground structures interwoven with massive machinery would define här existence in ways beyond här ability to imagine for, perhaps, the good bulk of här life: the good bulk, that would be the part that weighs on .. dominates the rest, probably): (uedamhyka(ii)(00_00)(ii) is not completely convinced there is anything 'good' to come of it, beyond some vague restless need to persist in one's errors long enough to make some kind of recompense for them: hä lightly dusts the top of each capsule with a fine brush .. deposits them into the pack units: the white light reflects off of här hooded head): (probability: (df) u_connections / u_space, where, from a numeric standpoint, 0 functioned as a u_connector as a convergence between multiple u: which, in turn, functioned as floating probability arrays: the concept of points was replaced by convergence-spaces, a defining characteristic of which, as consequence, was that it could be either large or small: in this way interpulse flows had a bubble quality): (white reflecting off of chrome studs: at the heart of all of this was the concept of u): (monogurui agents would map out their book via a basic 6-foliate structure 6u): (each 6u was anchored by a u.0 function representing an interpulse measurement mapping of a temporal domain: (00_00) had devised a 6u mapping, m(0)phur, a u differential (measuring the change in a universalized consolidated capital flow intensity), sum of flows, background reverb, .. monogurui (always the 6th term of a 6u, constructed as an inverted residual): the result is a temporally fluid topological  reconciliation of eigenvalues .. sequences, relying heavily on direction neutral 'sums' referred to as interpulse flows, or U[u.0….u.I]: sometimes these were referred to more casually as 'paths', referencing the space between 2 or more of these given interpulse points: to the point where morikumura could be clearly conceptualized one would start with the assumption that U is incomplete): (.. uncertain (probabilistic) .. unconsistent (possessing the quality of reverb)): (one was faced with these flutters, even in circumstances close to stability: hence convergence as a defining conceptual attribute for objects occupying the system: the space which the reverb occupied was sometimes referred to as the m(0)phur-gap: probability measures were a function of direction-neutral models pushing out path arrays creating topological models as operating units: but these units were never static: they were always growing or constricting in uncomfortable ways: you ended up, in practice, handling arrays of eigenvalues as notches for constrained min max plottings: the clear plastic curves push outward, reflecting the white hydrophonic light uncomfortably .. permeated with cold air dew-units which would invert from the pressure dynamics .. pop out): (each coupling was made of white plastic or metal with white rubber inset holds): (capital flows by their nature attempt to fill every pressure level, to permeate themselves in the economic architecture of the world as is: in the pursuit of this equilibrium state these flows must contain themselves, .. must turn inward on themselves, like crystalline structures growing via implosion expansion reverb: the yamimonogurui force-pulse of mysterious forces is converted into definable contained entities, entities with certain developed volitional momentum of their own, formed in pre-embryonic material organism: u defined as matrix-shifts, or a mapping of one u_matrix to another: (00_00) (00_00) it didn't matter how misshapen or malformed the relationship was – as long as one could wrap a function on it one could utilize it productively for the formation of one's u_flows): (ultimately financial products could be abstracted out as universal derivatives): (at a 10 to 15 growth rate in u one can swallow a 5 to 10 drop without  clearing 0)."
