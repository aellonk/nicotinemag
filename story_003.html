          <p class="text credits">Over the past decade, Elizabeth Glaessner has conjured a saturated and densely layered world of
              transformation and multiplicity. Welcoming amorphousness in her subjects and their surroundings,
              Glaessner’s surreal universe is populated by beings and tricksters that are pictured in states of becoming or
              undoing. Rich with art historical and cultural allusions, her work does not offer a narrative or fable. Rather,
              Glaessner evokes ambivalent moods unmoored by virtue and vice.</p>
          <p class="text credits">Working in oil, acrylic and pure pigments dispersed with water and various binders, Glaessner’s technique
              shifts between formal articulation and non-representational gesture. Reflecting the metamorphosis occurring
              within her subjects, each painting is grounded by a fluid primordial color field. Her diaphanous subjects
              emerge as limbs while finer features spring from tonal and textural convergence. Enraptured by suns,
              moons, seasons and tides, the resulting transfigurations are unequivocally products of their environment.</p>
          <p class="text credits">Throughout her work, Glaessner depicts characters challenging the codified conventions surrounding
              contemporary morality. Unencumbered by judgment and exultant in their ambiguity, Glaessner’s figures
              reflect a purity of emotional expression that most are too afraid to confront. Employing her own visual
              vocabulary as well as art historical influences ranging from Edvard Munch to Helen Frankenthaler,
              Glaessner unveils a liminal space traditionally concealed by established dichotomies such as control and
              chaos; innocence and guilt; and ultimately, morality and depravity.</p>
          <p class="text credits">Elizabeth Glaessner was born in Palo Alto, California in 1984 and grew up in Houston, Texas. After
              receiving her BA from Trinity University in 2006, she moved to New York and completed her MFA at the
              New York Academy of Art in 2013. She was awarded a postgraduate fellowship at the New York Academy
              of Art in 2013, a residency at GlogauAIR, Berlin in 2013 and a residency at the Leipzig International Art
              Programme in 2012. She has presented two solo exhibitions with P·P·O·W, in 2014 and 2018, and has
              contributed to group exhibitions throughout North America and Europe. Glaessner was recently included in
              the group exhibition Les Yeux Clos at Perrotin, Paris and Go Figure!?, an online exhibition at Sprüth
              Magers, curated by Ed Tang and Jonathan Cheung. In October, Galerie Perrotin will present a solo booth of
              new paintings at Frieze London, 2021. Her third solo exhibition at P·P·O·W will open in February 2022.</p>
